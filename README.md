This open source recipe collection is inspired by Brian Dominick's [Codewriting](https://github.com/briandominick/codewriting).

I cook nearly every night, never use recipes, and rarely cook the same thing twice. After reading the above book I decided to begin posting my meals to an open source repository to help people discover cheap, healthy dinners they can cook themselves.

These recipes use simple ingredients that you can find at your local grocery store. I do most of my shopping at discount stores such as Lidl, Trader Joe's, Aldi, and (for certain items the other stores don't carry) Wal-Mart.
